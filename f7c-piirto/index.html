	                <p>Dear AS400 Cadets, </p><p>Congratulations!!! YOU DID IT! You made it. I can't bet how surreal that must feel. You have just completed four arduous, productive, successful, and fun years of Air Force ROTC. That is a major accomplishment that you saw through till the very end, even with a whole pandemic thrown into the mix. All of the underclassmen admire your perseverance and literally want to be you right now. However, we know it takes a certain kind of Cadet to get there, so for the mean time we're looking up to you, learning, and modeling ourselves after your expertise and leadership, so that one day we can be exceptional graduating Cadets as well. Best of luck in the big blue Air Force. HOOOah!</p>

	                <p>Congratulations, what you have been working towards is finally here! Although, it hasn't looked exactly what you probably imagined, the lessons you've learned and experiences you have made won't ever leave you. Your class has done a great job of preparing, equipping, and modeling for the underclassmen in ROTC. Many of you have been so important to my own development. Never forget the memories and the lessons, they will always be there to guide you. We love you all, and wish you the absolute best! </p>

	                <p>To the AS 400s,</p><p>As I have become acquainted with the AFRTOC universe this year, I've been impressed time and time again by your leadership, professionalism, and organization. Oh, how smoothly things run at Det 890--all due to you! Everyone has a purpose, everyone is on the same page, and everyone is working together. When things don't go according to plan, you quickly adapt. You've worked hard all year to train and prepare the classes below you, and you've modeled the way for us all. I've felt supported and taken care of, and I've noticed just how much time and energy each of you dedicates to being outstanding. Thank you for helping ROTC feel like a family, for preparing us so well, and for lovingly passing the torch. I wish that we had time to properly celebrate all your efforts and accomplishments, but I know that you'll all move on to bigger and better things in no time. Best of luck next year!</p>

	                <p>Thank you, Class of 2020 for being helpful, flexible and reliable throughout this confusing and challenging semester. Y'all have set an extremely high bar for the rest of Det 890, and your impacts on the rest of us cadets will not be forgotten. I wish y'all the best of luck in your careers and look forward to hearing of your accomplishments in the Air Force. Thank you for being so open and willing to help us, even the 100s. It means a lot to be able to come to you outside of ROTC if we have a problem or issue and know that you'll be there to help! Thanks again, and best of luck!!</p>

We all learned a lot from you, both in and out of ROTC. It is unfortunate your final year had to go this way, but there is something we can be thankful for. While other groups on Grounds or at our campuses might not see their graduating class again, I know I will see some if not all of you in the big blue. But until then, thanks, and I hope to see y'all soon!</p>

Starting ROTC as a freshman, you helped us learn the ropes and the do's and dont's of ROTC. You worked alongside us and helped teach us how to survive our 200 year. Not gonna lie when y'all came back from Field Training it was a bit awkward at first but you worked hard to mentor us and challenged us to become better cadets. After we got back from Field Training, you continued to mentor us and helped us learn the ropes of becoming a POC. I know this year didn't end like we all would have liked, but know that we are so thankful for all you have taught us and we know you're going to do great things in the big blue! :)</p>

	                <p>It has been nothing short of a pleasure to go through this ROTC experience with you all. You set the example for us, especially entering the POC. As a matter of fact, there were several times during my 200 year where I was not sure if I would be an effective POC or not or if I would be successful at FT, because there is just so much to learn. However, an inspiring thought for me throughout that learning process was over the previous year watching how much your class grew into the leaders you are today. I knew I could do it because you all had done it and were always there to help support us throught that process. I fully expect every single one of you to continue to make an impact on the lives of those around you and to be there for your fellow Airmen upon commissioning! Thanks again for being awesome!</p>

From our AS/100 Year, you helped teach us to how to survive the strenuous times of LLAB and helped push us to work harder at PT. During our AS/200 year, we watched you all return from Field Training with a fire in your eyes, return to help us become ready for those crazy 2 weeks you had just experienced. It was during this time I had the best leaders and teachers and I thank all the POC that helped me grow my confidence and leadership to get ready for my Field Training. And after we returned, you helped us form and mold our leadership style, answering our questions, and showing us massive amounts of patience and kindness. And we look forward to all the times we can help you all as Officers in the United States Air Force in the near future. Thank You again for all of your support.</p>

	                <p>AS 400 Cadets,</p><p>Coming in for my first year of ROTC, the thought of the upperclassmen graduating really never crossed my mind. Yet now that we are at home in this endless loop of quarantine, the end of the year has arrived too abruptly and I am realizing everything and everyone I will miss from this class. Not only have you been the studs I have looked up to in a military aspect, but you have also shown me what true wingmanship really means... and I do not mean that in a cheesy, cliche way. The bond each and every one of has through this shared experience is beautiful and admirable. Remember those bonds and relationships going forward. Anyways, it is truly bittersweet to say goodbye so early and I wish that I could have had an actual full year with all of you, but thank you for everything you have done for your underclassmen cadets and this detachment as a whole. Thank you for giving me role models to look up to... for showing me how to lead... for teaching me how to have fun... for sharing laughs and advice. But most of all, thank you for giving me a great example of what to look forward to in 3 years. You all have amazing futures laid in front of you, so just do something great!</p>

I can say honestly that wherever your first assignment takes you, the airmen under you, and even the airmen over you, will be extremely lucky to have one of you as a lieutenant in their respective unit.

	                <p>Although I am a 100 and have only had a short season to get to know everyone, I wanted to let you know how influential and vital you have been to me and this detachment. I know I speak for many GMC when I say that we saw the pride and leadership you all possess with poise. For someone like myself, who had no prior military knowledge, coming into my first year of ROTC was difficult and quite overwhelming. During those challenging times, I may have felt differently about the positive influence that the program would have on my life, but now I look back at this past year and I am thankful. I may want to forget the constant fear of figuring out whether the POC twenty feet in front of me was male or female and analyzing their face to match a name before it was too late; or fumbling over my words saying “good morning” when in reality it was 7 p.m. at night. Yet, I will remember how thankful I am that God put me in ROTC at Detachment 890 to have you all teach and guide me, as well as, thankful that you demanded nothing but excellence, not only from yourself as leaders, but also from your fellow peers, and from us GMC below. I have been in situations in my past where leaders over me were toxic. They did not care about the program or those participating. They lacked passion, became prideful and simply slacked off once they held a position of leadership, all with the excuse that it was their last year to just have fun. Their leadership, or lack of, set the tone for everyone else to follow and I watched as those with so much potential became apathetic and unmotivated. But not with you. Never once did I sense this arrogance. I saw selfless leaders who understood the importance of their role in our detachment, as well as, their role in fighting for our country. I saw leaders who deeply cared and displayed guidance as well as character that will shape the future of the U.S. Air Force and our world. Thank you for providing me with someone to look up to and aspire to be in the future. I know God has an amazing plan for your lives as you have already touched mine.</p>
